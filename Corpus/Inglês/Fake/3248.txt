(The Adobo Chronicles) – It is common knowledge that Ronald Reagan loved mac n’cheese. Bill Clinton, before his heart bypass, indulged in jalapeño cheeseburgers. How about Barack Obama?  In an exclusive interview with White House executive chef Cristeta Comerford, she indicated that Obama does not have one particular favorite food. “But he loves Filipino cuisine,” she said.  Comerford, a Filipino American, has so far served as executive chef under three U.S. Presidents – George W. Bush, Clinton and Obama. She is the first woman and the first of Asian descent who has served as White House executive chef. Halo-Halo  “There are so many Filipino foods that the president likes, but on top of his list is halo-halo, the Filipino version of the Hawaiian shaved ice,” Comerford said. Asked to name the top ten Filipino foods fancied by Obama, Comerford gave us the following list:  . Halo-Halo (shaved ice)  . Dinuguan (pork blood stew)  . Balut (duck embryo)  . Kinilaw na Kambing (ceviche-style goat meat)  . Tocino (sweet cured pork)  . Laing (spicy taro leaves)  . Pinakbet (Filipino version of ratatouille)  . Crispy Pata (Deep-fried pork knuckles)  . Kare-Kare (Tripe and vegetables in peanut sauce)  Asked how often Filipino food is served to the Obamas, Comerford, with a wink in her eye, said, “That’s classified information!” Rate this:",1
