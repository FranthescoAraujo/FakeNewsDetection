1) 8 government piggy banks (the government promise the use of piggy banks was not meant to be derogatory) which can be smashed open by gardaí with a hammer. The exact contents of them are unknown, but after shaking them and holding them to their ears, GRA representatives were said to be ‘excited’. 
2) A guard will be picked via lottery system and given the chance to use a taser on Leo Varadkar. The Taoiseach was adamant this was included in the deal despite it not being among the GRA’s demands. 
3) One new uniform per station, to be worn by officers on a rotation basis. 
4) A pat on the back from the government every month with a variation of the phrase ‘well done’ to accompany it. 
5) Vague agreement to provide resources to upgrade the force from the 1870s to at least 1960s standards by 2050. 
6) €15 premium payment on annual leave but all gardaí will be forced to holiday in a caravan park in Wicklow. 
7) Free team bonding trip to Tayto Park, and tickets to the Late Late Toy Show for all 12,500 gardaí who were set to strike on the condition that the GRA tell the public that the government are ‘the best’. 
8) 100% mortgages and free pints in exchange for arresting at least one opposition TD on drink driving charges. 
9) An increase of 4 cents per year in the shoelace allowance if gardaí turn a blind eye to Simon Harris’s burgeoning Crystal Meth empire.
