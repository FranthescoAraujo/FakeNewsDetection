14034,BREAKING: Obama Says There Were No Scandals During His Administration! HAHAHA!,Scott Osborn,"0 comments Obama was speaking to donors at a private fundraiser in California when he railed against former House Oversight Committee Chair Darrell Issa for calling his administration corrupt. 
“Here’s a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history — despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration,” Obama said! 
Obama has had more scandals than any president in history! Just because the MSM refuses to report on them does not mean they do not exist! 
Breitbart reports : 
Issa was the key figure in several investigations of the Obama administration, including the Fast and Furious debacle with Attorney General Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton’s failure in Benghazi, the failures in the Veterans Affairs department, and the IRS using its power to target conservative Tea Party groups for investigations. 
Obama accused Issa of wasting taxpayer money “on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere.” 
“This guy has spent all his time simply trying to obstruct, to feed the same sentiments that resulted in Donald Trump becoming their nominee,” Obama said. 
We could list 77 scandals, but here are just 7 of the biggest!
