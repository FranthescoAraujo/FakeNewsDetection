4.) Cleanse your crystals if needed after you are done. Self- Empowerment Chakra Recharge 
Perfect for when you are lacking confidence in yourself. 
1.) Choose one crystal that resonates with you and place it out to be charged in the sunlight for at least 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can choose 7 crystals â€“ one for each chakra. 
2.) Once the crystal has been charged, start rubbing it between your hands to generate heat and more energy. 
3.) When you feel the heat or charge of the crystal, place your hands over your root chakra or pelvis area (touch your skin not your clothes). Allow the energy to sink in to this area of your body.
