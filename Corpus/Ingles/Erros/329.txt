1. Heat the oats in low medium flame until it gets golden brown. Have you ever noticed that whatever you are trying to make, the recipe always tells you to heat whatever you are trying to heat till it becomes golden brown? 
2. Now heat the peanut in similar low flame until it becomes peacock blue. Just kidding. Heat till golden brown only. 
3. Luckily, jaggery is kind of golden brown. No need to heat it. 
4. Put the oats and peanut together into a mixie and run the blender. 
5. Oops, wait. In your hurry to get on with it, you ran the blender without closing it. Now go clean the mess you created. 
6. Close the lid firmly and run the blender till the oats and peanut are finely commingled. 
7. Wonder what the heck is commingled. 
8. Now remove a portion of oats-peanut mix and keep it aside. Add to the remaining portion in the jar some jaggery. Run the blender till they are finely mixed. Now make a similar blend out of the removed portion too. 
9. Spread the fresh mix on a plate and start making ladoo balls out of them. Since you are making them the balls will come off and not stick together.
