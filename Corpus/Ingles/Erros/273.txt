14293,Re: It Is Now Mathematically Impossible To Pay Off The U.S. National Debt,Don,"It Is Now Mathematically Impossible To Pay Off The U.S. National Debt By Michael Snyder, on February 4th, 2010 
A lot of people are very upset about the rapidly increasing U.S. national debt these days and they are demanding a solution. What they don’t realize is that there simply is not a solution under the current U.S. financial system. It is now mathematically impossible for the U.S. government to pay off the U.S. national debt. You see, the truth is that the U.S. government now owes more dollars than actually exist. If the U.S. government went out today and took every single penny from every single American bank, business and taxpayer, they still would not be able to pay off the national debt. And if they did that, obviously American society would stop functioning because nobody would have any money to buy or sell anything. 
And the U.S. government would still be massively in debt. 
So why doesn’t the U.S. government just fire up the printing presses and print a bunch of money to pay off the debt? 
Well, for one very simple reason. 
That is not the way our system works. 
You see, for more dollars to enter the system, the U.S. government has to go into more debt. 
The U.S. government does not issue U.S. currency – the Federal Reserve does. 
The Federal Reserve is a private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers. 
If you will pull a dollar bill out and take a look at it, you will notice that it says “Federal Reserve Note” at the top. 
It belongs to the Federal Reserve. 
The U.S. government cannot simply go out and create new money whenever it wants under our current system. 
Instead, it must get it from the Federal Reserve. 
So, when the U.S. government needs to borrow more money (which happens a lot these days) it goes over to the Federal Reserve and asks them for some more green pieces of paper called Federal Reserve Notes. 
The Federal Reserve swaps these green pieces of paper for pink pieces of paper called U.S. Treasury bonds. The Federal Reserve either sells these U.S. Treasury bonds or they keep the bonds for themselves (which happens a lot these days). 
So that is how the U.S. government gets more green pieces of paper called “U.S. dollars” to put into circulation. But by doing so, they get themselves into even more debt which they will owe even more interest on. 
So every time the U.S. government does this, the national debt gets even bigger and the interest on that debt gets even bigger. 
Are you starting to get the picture? 
As you read this, the U.S. national debt is approximately 12 trillion dollars, although it is going up so rapidly that it is really hard to pin down an exact figure. 
So how much money actually exists in the United States today? 
Well, there are several ways to measure this. 
The “M0″ money supply is the total of all physical bills and currency, plus the money on hand in bank vaults and all of the deposits those banks have at reserve banks. As of mid-2009, the Federal Reserve said that this amount was about 908 billion dollars. 
The “M1″ money supply includes all of the currency in the “M0″ money supply, along with all of the money held in checking accounts and other checkable accounts at banks, as well as all money contained in travelers’ checks. According to the Federal Reserve , this totaled approximately 1.7 trillion dollars in December 2009, but not all of this money actually “exists” as we will see in a moment. 
The “M2″ money supply includes everything in the “M1″ money supply plus most other savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small denomination time deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000). According to the Federal Reserve , this totaled approximately 8.5 trillion dollars in December 2009, but once again, not all of this money actually “exists” as we will see in a moment. 
The “M3″ money supply includes everything in the “M2″ money supply plus all other CDs (large time deposits and institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve does not keep track of M3 anymore, but according to ShadowStats.com it is currently somewhere in the neighborhood of 14 trillion dollars. But again, not all of this “money” actually “exists” either. 
So why doesn’t it exist? 
It is because our financial system is based on something called fractional reserve banking. 
When you go over to your local bank and deposit $100, they do not keep your $100 in the bank. Instead, they keep only a small fraction of your money there at the bank and they lend out the rest to someone else. Then, if that person deposits the money that was just borrowed at the same bank, that bank can loan out most of that money once again. In this way, the amount of “money” quickly gets multiplied. But in reality, only $100 actually exists. The system works because we do not all run down to the bank and demand all of our money at the same time. 
According to the New York Federal Reserve Bank , fractional reserve banking can be explained this way…. 
“ If the reserve requirement is 10%, for example, a bank that receives a $100 deposit may lend out $90 of that deposit. If the borrower then writes a check to someone who deposits the $90, the bank receiving that deposit can lend out $81. As the process continues, the banking system can expand the initial deposit of $100 into a maximum of $1,000 of money ($100+$90+81+$72.90+…=$1,000).” 
So much of the “money” out there today is basically made up out of thin air. 
In fact, most banks have no reserve requirements at all on savings deposits, CDs and certain kinds of money market accounts. Primarily, reserve requirements apply only to “transactions deposits” – essentially checking accounts. 
The truth is that banks are freer today to dramatically “multiply” the amounts deposited with them than ever before. But all of this “multiplied” money is only on paper – it doesn’t actually exist. 
The point is that the broadest measures of the money supply (M2 and M3) vastly overstate how much “real money” actually exists in the system. 
So if the U.S. government went out today and demanded every single dollar from all banks, businesses and individuals in the United States it would not be able to collect 14 trillion dollars (M3) or even 8.5 trillion dollars (M2) because those amounts are based on fractional reserve banking. 
So the bottom line is this…. 
#1) If all money owned by all American banks, businesses and individuals was gathered up today and sent to the U.S. government, there would not be enough to pay off the U.S. national debt. 
#2) The only way to create more money is to go into even more debt which makes the problem even worse. 
You see, this is what the whole Federal Reserve System was designed to do. It was designed to slowly drain the massive wealth of the American people and transfer it to the elite international bankers. 
It is a game that is designed so that the U.S. government cannot win. As soon as they create more money by borrowing it, the U.S. government owes more than what was created because of interest. 
If you owe more money than ever was created you can never pay it back. 
That means perpetual debt for as long as the system exists. 
It is a system designed to force the U.S. government into ever-increasing amounts of debt because there is no escape. 
We could solve this problem by shutting down the Federal Reserve and restoring the power to issue U.S. currency to the U.S. Congress (which is what the U.S. Constitution calls for). But the politicians in Washington D.C. are not about to do that. 
So unless you are willing to fundamentally change the current system, you might as well quit complaining about the U.S. national debt because it is now mathematically impossible to pay it off. 
***UPDATE*** 
It has been suggested that the same dollar can be used to pay off debt over and over – this is theoretically true as long as the dollar remains in the system. 
For example, if the U.S. government gives China a dollar to pay off a debt, there is a good chance that the U.S. government will be able to acquire that dollar again and use it to pay off another debt. 
However, this is not true when debt is retired with the Federal Reserve. In that case, money is actually removed from the system. In fact, because of the “money multiplier”, when debt is retired with the Federal Reserve it can remove ten times that amount of money (and actually more, but let’s not get too technical) from the system. 
You see, fractional reserve banking works both ways. When $100 is introduced into the system, it can theoretically create $1000 as the example in the article above demonstrates. However, when that $100 is removed, it can have the opposite impact. 
And considering the fact that the Federal Reserve “purchased” the vast majority of new U.S. government debt last year , we have got a real mess on our hands. 
Even if a way could be figured out how to pay off all the debt we owe to foreign nations (such as China, Japan, etc.) it would still be mathematically impossible to pay off the debt that we owe to the Federal Reserve which is exploding so fast that it is hard to even keep track of. 
Of course we could repudiate that debt and shut down the Federal Reserve, but very few in Washington D.C. have any interest in doing that. 
It has also been suggested that instead of just using dollars to pay off the U.S. national debt, we could use the assets of the U.S. government to pay it off. 
That is rather extreme, but let us consider that for a moment. 
That total value of all physical assets in the United States, both publicly and privately owned, is somewhere in the neighborhood of 45 to 50 trillion dollars. Of course the idea of the U.S. government “owning” every single asset of the American people is repugnant to our entire way of life, but let’s assume that for a moment. 
According to the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government , which is an official United States government report, the total liabilities of the United States government, including future social security and medicare payments that the U.S. government is already committed to pay out, now exceed 65 TRILLION dollars. This amount is more than the entire GDP of the whole world. 
In fact, there are other authors who have written that the actual figure for the future liabilities of the U.S. government should be much higher, but let’s be conservative and go with 65 trillion for now. 
So, if the U.S. government took control of all physical assets in the United States and sold them off, it could not even make enough money to pay for everything that the U.S. government is already on the hook for. 
Ouch. 
If you have not read the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government , you really should. Actually the 2009 report should be available very soon if it isn’t already. If anyone knows if it is available, please let us know. 
The truth is that the U.S. government is in much bigger financial trouble than we have been led to believe. 
For example, according to the report (which remember is an official U.S. government report) the real U.S. budget deficit for 2008 was not 455 billion dollars. It was actually 5.1 trillion dollars. 
So why the difference? 
The CBO’s 455 billion figure is based on cash accounting, while the 5.1 trillion figure in the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government is based on GAAP accounting. GAAP accounting is what is used by all the major firms on Wall Street and it is regarded as a much more accurate reflection of financial reality. 
So needless to say, the United States is in a financial mess of unprecedented magnitude. 
So what should we do? Does anyone have any suggestions? 
***UPDATE 2*** 
We have received a lot of great comments on this article. Trying to understand the U.S. financial system (even after studying it for years) can be very difficult at times. In fact, it can almost seem like playing 3 dimensional chess. 
Several readers have correctly pointed out that when the U.S. money supply is expanded by the Federal Reserve, the interest that is to be paid on that new debt is not created. 
So where does the money to pay that interest come from? Well, eventually the money supply has to be expanded some more. But that creates even more debt. 
That brings us to the next point. 
Several readers have insisted that the Federal Reserve is not privately owned and that since it returns “most” of the profits it makes to the U.S. government that we should not be concerned about the debt owed to it. 
The truth is that what you have with the Federal Reserve is layers of ownership. The following was originally posted on the Federal Reserve’s website…. 
“The twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, which were established by Congress as the operating arms of the nation’s central banking system, are organized much like private corporations – possibly leading to some confusion about “ownership.” For example, the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks. However, owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the System. The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan; dividends are, by law, 6 percent per year.” 
So Federal Reserve “stock” is owned by member banks. So who owns the member banks? Well, when you sift through additional layers of ownership, you will ultimately find that people like the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers and the Queen of England have very large ownership interests in the big banks. But there are so many layers of ownership that they are able to disguise themselves well. 
You see, these people are not stupid. They did not become the richest people in the world by being morons. It was the banking elite of the world who designed the Federal Reserve and it is the banking elite of the world who benefit the most from the Federal Reserve today. In the article above when we described the Federal Reserve as “a private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers” we may have been oversimplifying things a bit, but it is the essence of what is going on. 
In an excellent article that she did on the Federal Reserve, Ellen Brown described a number of the ways that the Federal Reserve makes money for those who own it…. 
The interest on bonds acquired with its newly-issued Federal Reserve Notes pays the Fed’s operating expenses plus a guaranteed 6% return to its banker shareholders. A mere 6% a year may not be considered a profit in the world of Wall Street high finance, but most businesses that manage to cover all their expenses and give their shareholders a guaranteed 6% return are considered “for profit” corporations. 
In addition to this guaranteed 6%, the banks will now be getting interest from the taxpayers on their “reserves.” The basic reserve requirement set by the Federal Reserve is 10%. The website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York explains that as money is redeposited and relent throughout the banking system, this 10% held in “reserve” can be fanned into ten times that sum in loans; that is, $10,000 in reserves becomes $100,000 in loans. Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.8 puts the total “loans and leases in bank credit” as of September 24, 2008 at $7,049 billion. Ten percent of that is $700 billion. That means we the taxpayers will be paying interest to the banks on at least $700 billion annually – this so that the banks can retain the reserves to accumulate interest on ten times that sum in loans. 
The banks earn these returns from the taxpayers for the privilege of having the banks’ interests protected by an all-powerful independent private central bank, even when those interests may be opposed to the taxpayers’ — for example, when the banks use their special status as private money creators to fund speculative derivative schemes that threaten to collapse the U.S. economy. Among other special benefits, banks and other financial institutions (but not other corporations) can borrow at the low Fed funds rate of about 2%. They can then turn around and put this money into 30-year Treasury bonds at 4.5%, earning an immediate 2.5% from the taxpayers, just by virtue of their position as favored banks. A long list of banks (but not other corporations) is also now protected from the short selling that can crash the price of other stocks. 
The reality is that there are a lot of ways that the Federal Reserve is a money-making tool. Yes, they do return “some” of their profits to the U.S. government each year. But the Federal Reserve is NOT a government agency and it DOES make profits. 
So just how much money is made over there? The truth is that we have to rely on what the Federal Reserve tells us, because they have never been subjected to a comprehensive audit by the U.S. government. 
Ever. 
Right now there is legislation going through Congress that would change that, and the Federal Reserve is fighting it tooth and nail. They are warning that such an audit could cause a financial disaster. 
What are they so afraid of? 
Are they afraid that we might get to peek inside and see what they have been up to all these years? 
If you are a history buff, then you probably know that debates about a “central bank” go all the way back to the Founding Fathers. 
The European banking elite have always been determined to control our currency, and that is exactly what is happening today. 
Ever since the Federal Reserve was created, there have been members of the U.S. Congress that have been trying to warn the American people about the insidious nature of this institution. 
Just check out what the Honorable Louis McFadden, Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee had to say all the way back in the 1930s…. 
“Some people think that the Federal Reserve Banks are United States Government institutions. They are private monopolies which prey upon the people of these United States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers; foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers; and rich and predatory money lenders.” 
The Federal Reserve is not the solution and it never has been. 
The Federal Reserve is the problem. 
Any thoughts? OOPS! – U.S. Government Unemployment Numbers Have To Be Revised Because They Were Off By Almost One MILLION! » Bart 
Has there ever been a time in history when money in circulation equalled or exceeded all credit/debt – I doubt it. As long as there is one person willing to extend credit to another you are going to have this imbalance. 
The big problem we just went through with the credit bubble was that the central banks lost control of the money supply. This led to a global credit bubble, which popped when there was a run on Lehman’s bank because the credit markets froze (largely due to an inability to price risk). 
A run on the bank is when people have a money preference and pull out all their cash. This used to result in liquidity crises like 1907 when the British demanded we pay all our debt in gold. Now, the FDIC pays out on bank runs or the Fed does. We just went through the largest liquidity crisis in history and the Fed handled by doubling the assets on their balance sheet they created trillions in reserves. More importantly this “debt” that is the credit that was extended has 0% interest attached, so as the economy stabilizes the debt-service shoudl be pretty easy. 
You’re right that in our system when we create money we create debt. I prefer direct money creation where Congress creates money to pay for infrastructure and that’s how we expand the money supply. Blade 
Bart…is your last name Simpson by any chance? If I have ten bucks and loan you five there is still ten bucks in circulation!! Hellooo! It is when I go to the printing press and print up another fiver like I just lent you and stick it in my pocket so I still have ten that is the problem!! 
In 1835, under President Andrew Jackson, the US Federal Budget was balanced and the National Debt was paid in full. This has never happened since. This fine man did not appreciate Rockefeller and his fellow printer schiesters!! Get some history knowledge Bart, then you might be smart enough to grow some backbone instead of sounding comically loony! Josh 
Who exactly do we owe all this money to? Let them try and collect it. Worst case we stop spending trillions of the defense budget. Honestly people can’t realize the whole monetary system is scam to turn as all into slaves and deny us much as possible so that New World Order can use all as much output as possible for their own designs. RIck M. 
The problem isn’t the lending or borrowing. i.e. if I borrow a cup of sugar from my neighbor, they don’t expect to have a 5-pound bag returned to them as payment. 
Yes, there WAS a time that money exceeded the debt, it was when the people worked to save for what they purchased, or loaned it without interest. The issue that makes the banking system so very flawed is that they loan money (or a percentage thereof) that was entrusted to them to others with the interest collected from all parties making use of the original individuals actual deposit. 
While one could argue that this is a reasonable thing to do; which it was only slightly less corrupt in intention when there was REAL money, EG: Gold or silver, on hold; the fact that the depositors are now depositing federal reserve notes (which are counted at face value – already fractionally inflated) to be loaned using fractional accounting. THIS is what causes the so-called debt bubble. 
The process cannot go on indefinitely, just as any pyramid or ponzi scheme… sooner or later the whole thing falls apart because there aren’t sufficient real funds to support the illusion. 
The author here is absolutely correct, there isn’t enough “money” to repay the bankers, so the eventual collapse of the entire system is inevitable. Since the debt was incurred against treasury bonds, the only way to repay it now is with REAL PROPERTY since we don’t have real reserves to back it. In essence – they will own everything as it becomes nationalized to cover the increasing debt. Catch-22 
Um, yeah, I agree that we ignored the Constitutional requirement BUT: If we now were to somehow close down the Fed, would you really want to turn over the power of money creation to the current congress? I cannot imagine letting the 535 economically-ignorant party hacks devise a sound replacement. I fear for our republic. ebeye 
It’s ALWAYS been impossible to pay off the “debt”! The interest has to be created, which is more debt! The only way to eliminate it is to repudiate the Federal Reserve and it’s claim of debt upon the people, then revert to either a nationally derived currency, or simply allow any form of currency to be used.

The creature from Jeckyl Island has now officially sealed the fate of ALL future generations of Americans. The really scary thing about this financial meltdown is the historical precedent that has benn established. What is the favorite remedy that corrupt governments use when faced with economic collapse? That’s right. War! Philippians 6-12. Russ L. Smith 
So they “doubled their balance sheet” which means that everything lost 50% of it’s value, or every dollar became 50 cents. That will make paying off the debt twice as hard. Don Robertson 
Yes, it is very alarming the sort of things mathematics can point out. But do not start throwing your money out the window for the wind to catch and take away. 
There is absolutely nothing in the Universe that can be described EXACTLY by mathematics. Why not? Because there are no two things anywhere in the Universe that are so perfectly alike, we can add them 1+1 and say “2” describes these things to every extent possible. 
The American dollar is still coveted by more people on this planet than any other currency. 
Not one in a 100 people reading this post have ever seen a Yuan, a Euro, or even a Peso. Not one in a thousand has one in their pocket! 
I live right on the Canadian border. The Canadians come over here to shop because milk is like $6.00 a gallon in Canada. They come over here to buy gasoline, and fill up five gallon containers they take home in their trunks. 
And on the other border? The Mexicans, and the South Americans crash the border gates to get in. 
The strength of an economy can be measured by the amount of currency that can be floated WITHOUT all that currency causing such inflation that buying power is destroyed. 
You can spend dollars in every country in the world. 
The dollar bill is the currency even the Iranian street vendors -hoard in their mattresses. 
The big economic problem right now is deflation. And it’s a wonderful problem to have, if you have money in the bank, or even if you just have a job. 
The reason for the deflation is, not everyone does have a job. 
The credit economy is the culprit. Put your money in the bank. Leave it there. That’s the best advice anyone can give. 
Forget the debt. No one is asking to have it paid off. No one ever thought it would be paid off. 
Believe me, there are a lot of gold bugs today who are licking their wounds from this pop of their bubble. Expect it to get worse for them too. You cannot spend gold at the local hardware store. Jim 
Keep a written journal of these days and your perception of them. What you knew and what is. They will be a window into darkness and why. Truthteller 
Turn the Fed into an actual department of the Federal Government or amalgamate it with the Treasury. Money can then be issued without interest having to be paid to a private bank. At one stroke, a large part of the current debt can be removed as the debt owing to the ‘former Federal Reserve’ would be cancelled. Or is this too simple an idea? Mr. Universe 
It is an excellent idea, i can just see a hole in it though, if we were to impliment this plan, whats to stop the government from collecting the debt from it’s citzens??? just wondering very, very good plan though. 
Simple solutions are often the ones that are the most overlooked 
Sincerely 
http://home.iae.nl/users/lightnet/creator/nationaldebt.htm This Awareness indicates that you must understand that when the Federal Reserve bank, the privately owned Federal Reserve bank, was given authority to print Federal Reserve notes instead of the Treasury Department writing the Treasury Notes as directed by the U.S. Constitution, these Federal Reserve notes were not printed to be given out to the economy, in the way as the Treasury Notes of the Treasury Department. Rather, they were loaned to the U.S. government and then circulated into society, and society was required to pay back interest on the IRS notes and that amount of interest accumulated to the point of approximately 5 trillion dollars at this time (Revelations of Awareness newsletter issue no. 430 1994), to where, if everything in the United States were sold, half of the debt would still be owed. 
This Awareness indicates that the Treasury Department has the potential for totally denouncing the Federal Reserve debt of 5 trillion dollars because it was illegal in the first place. The Treasury Department in the U.S. Constitution is the only proper way of financing the nation; Congress, operating the Treasury Department has the right to mint and coin money, and set the value thereof. 
This Awareness indicates that in this fact, the Federal Reserve was never given any such a right, even with the vote of the Congress, because Congress did not have the right to relegate its obligations to the Federal Reserve, therefore the entire debt of five trillion dollars, because it was illegal in the fist place, is not forcible in a technical sense. MisterMoney 
Inflation is the plan! 
The debt can be repaid in cheaper dollars, so these politicians think, when the dollar drops in value, and they are able to raise more taxes at higher levels. But this only works if wages and earnings raise in tandem with inflation. 
For example, if sales tax is 6%, and I buy a can of beans for a $1.00 I pay 6 cents in taxes. When inflation hits and that can of beans now costs $3.00, I pay 18 cents in taxes. And my higher wages or salary move me up in the tax brackets, so I pay more taxes on the inflated dollars, as do corporations. 
The politicians will never say it, but that is the plan, just inflate this debt down to zilch, public be damned. Rob 
Bart, 
I applaud your attempt to explain the situation… but it sounds like you are reciting a Economics 101 text book, and no offense intended, it would seem that you are not entirely knowledgeable of the facts. 
Your post is entirely ignorant of the politics behind money. 
What lead to our current situation? Your statement that the central banks lost control of the money supply is over simplification, at best, ignorance at worst. Over the past two decades, at the behest of powerful interest groups and lobbyist, Congress dismantled and restructured the then existing regulatory restrictions that protected the economy from the text book situation which you described. And the result? It was predicted many years ago… screamed from the mountaintops for anyone to hear. But no one paid attention. Technically those vested with the power to create law don’t actually break the law. When the regulation and rule of law are manipulated, the eventual outcome of those changes are predictable. Knowledge is power. Ignorance is misfortune. 
As for runs on the bank… your illustration is a far cry from anything other than an illusion. While it is true that banks do not carry ready reserves of Cash on Hand to cover the cumulative balances of their accounts, the monies of the accounts themselves are properly recorded in the banks ledgers. Customers would not need to demand the balance in full, in cash. They could demand a cashiers check, or they could simply walk into another financial institution of their choosing and write a draft or check to transfer their monies from their old bank to their new institution. In the event of a bank failure, the proper action would have been to let the bank fail, at which point its assets would have been seized by the government, it deposits covered (to an extent) by FDIC, and then liquidated or managed in probate to recover losses on behalf of the injured parties. No Bail Outs would have been required. But there would have been a full accounting and investigation of corruption, mismanagement, maleficent, etc. Instead TARPs and Bailouts were appropriated and the monies were used to pay up to 100% on the dollar to the banks themselves, and subsequently the looting and pillaging of America began. 
Let there be no doubt that our current economic crisis is very real, far from over, and deliberately engineered. What are the short and long term implications? As for credit and liquidity, Wall Street is flush, but Main Street has dried up. TARP funds and various bailouts have been used, not to extend credit to Main Street, but rather to starve out the middle class, small and medium businesses, local banks and middle America so that those whom have access and control of credit may buy up practically anything and everything of value for pennies on the dollar. Classic and textbook “Grapes of Wraith” Economics 101, where the Barons and Tycoons of Industry run rough shod over desperate peoples in tough times. The gains are privatized and the losses are socialized. 
As for the long term implications… Doubling the money supply with 0% interest devalues the dollar and lends itself to several carnations of inflation, which may only be offset by artificially dampening cost of infrastructure and labor. In other words, importing cheap labor and exporting manufacturing and industry. Ring any bells? Ironically this only excelerates the phenomena. 
Ultimately, this incomprehensible level of debt may only be solved one of two ways, if not both: 1) The yielding and merger of the American dollar into a new hyper national or international financial union, or 2) Negotiation or Eradication of Debt via the Conquest of Wars and Treaties. Hmm… have you been watching the news lately? G8 What? U.N. / IMF / World Bank are doing what exactly? What treaties have been pending on the horizon? Pray tell me, what exactly were the goals of The Project for the New American Century and the Council on Foreign Relations? Please tell me that you are at least somewhat familiar with the organizations that advise and create the policies that our Congress reviews and our President enacts as policy? 
Bottom line: this is an engineered crisis with but one ultimate goal. Not merely the consolidation of wealth, but a consolidation of Power. The Federal Reserve itself has undergone consolidation. And Wall Street. And Main Street. And soon… as we continue marching towards globalization via Conquest and Treaty and the expansion of Power… Our National Sovereignty. 
And although I most certainly agree with you and applaud you on your preference for direct money creation where Congress creates money to pay for infrastructure to expand the economy, alas, there too you have unwittingly overlooked or intentionally omitted several key details. 
Although Congress does have the constitutional authority to mint coin and regulate the value of domestic and foreign monies, and does stimulate the economy with monies spent on militaries, infrastructure, and commerce, it ultimately can not and should not be responsible for insuring our economy. That said, for better or for worse, with our burgeoning debt our prosperity is being washed away. 
Debt is slavery. Expanding the money supply with fiat currency is a devils game. The only thing that truly generates wealth is labor and resources. You can not exploit resources without access, be it public or private, to land. Be it beef, beans, or bread, or be it lumber, steel, silver, or gold, without land the supply to resources is severed, and with it the capacitance for manufacturing and industry are also severed. 
We could easily transform our fiat money supply into that of one based entirely upon industrial and agricultural commodities, in addition to gold, silver, and other precious metals. But there in lies the crutch. Energy. For mining and harvesting, refinement and manufacturing, and for transportation. 
What, pray tell, has our current economic crises entailed? Hmm… Land, I.e. Real Estate. Commodities and Industry, I.e. Main Street and Jobs. Energy, I.e. oil, gas, coal, and electricity. Financing, I.e. Credit, cash, and liquidity. What exactly have been several of the key issues facing most people these past several years? 
Do you see the pattern yet. Do you recognize the cause, the reaction, the solution? It is NOT simply a matter of the central banks losing control of the money supply. It is about consolidation of financial and political power. Period. Once anyone realizes that, they will be better able to cope with the difficulties at hand and work towards regaining their financial footing, and hopefully, eventually, return to being financially independent.
