Ethan Hawke — that guy who was in that movie, or something — just claimed that it was “fascist” to hold Hillary Clinton accountable for the crimes she has committed. Oh and he also said that wanting to make American great again was racist. 
The Daily Beast published an interview with Hawke, gracing us with the musings of a man who should stick to memorizing the lines that someone else wrote for him. Then again, that’s what he did, he spewed liberal talking points. This is also known as the “stuff people incapable of higher level thinking” say in interviews to get attention. 
“When you see a man, if he wins, threatening to put his opponent in jail?” Hawke said in reference to Donald Trump promising that he would hold Clinton accountable for breaking the law. “That’s fascist behavior.” 
Yeah, you guys (oops, I forgot that’s sexist but fortunately I also just remembered that I don’t care). Anyway, Hawke may not understand how the law works, but it’s pretty simple, even for him. If you break a law, consequences are supposed to follow. 
For most of us, there are consequences, but Clinton has been held to a different set of standards than the rest of us. Just ask retired 4-star Gen. James Cartwright how that works — he’s facing jail time and a fine for doing something quite similar to Clinton yet she’s still running for president.
