1 1/2 cups white sugar 1 1/4 cups dry red wine ( this is a fancy one I use during the holidays) 12 ounces fresh cranberries, rinsed and sorted 1 cinnamon stick 2 tablespoons orange zest, cut into slivers Directions:
Combine sugar and red wine in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the cranberries, cinnamon stick and orange peel. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often until most of the cranberries have burst (about 15 minutes). Remove from heat and chill before serving. Cranberry Chutney Again, this is a bit of a more festive take on classic cranberry sauce. Perfect with turkey and other holiday dinners .
