17. Raven-Symoné 
Who? Actress and host of The View. 
Where would she move? Canada. 
“My confession for this election is if any Republican gets nominated, I’m going to move to Canada with my entire family. I already have my ticket,” she said on The View. 
Note: Her leaving was contingent on any Republican candidate winning the election–not just Trump.
