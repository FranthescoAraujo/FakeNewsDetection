11. LUNGWORT 
Lungwort is a tree-growing lichen that actually resembles lung tissue in appearance. However, this natural remedy doesnâ€™t just look the part. As early as the 1600s, lungwort has been used to promote lung and respiratory health and clear congestion. Pulmonaria selections come in all kinds so seek an herbologist for direction. Lungwort also contains compounds that are powerfully effective against harmful organisms that affect respiratory health.
