4323,Three Ways to Recharge Your Energy Using Crystals,stevew,"by Tanaaz 
Crystals are a great tool for healing, awakening and raising your vibration. When I first started out on my spiritual journey it took me a while to truly appreciate the power of a crystal. 
When you find a crystal that really resonates with you and that you feel really attracted to, you know you have found the right one. 
For years, I chose crystals based on the written metaphysical properties and for some reason they always felt “off” to me. When I started choosing crystals based on feeling alone, that is when I truly noticed their amazing abilities. 
Crystals contain a powerful energy for helping you to recharge your own vibration and connection to Spirit. 
Here are 3 ways to use your crystals to recharge: Mind, Body, Spirit Recharge 
Perfect for an all-over recharge for your energy, best done just before bed. 
1.) Choose 3 crystals that resonate with you- one for your mind, one for your body and one for your spirit. Make sure your crystals are cleansed. 
2.) Hold the physical body crystal in your hand and set your intention into the stone. Whisper what outcome or feeling you would like to create in your physical body. Hold the stone close to you as you repeat and feel your intention. Repeat this process for the mind and spirit crystals as well. 
3.) After setting your intention into your crystals, sleep with them under your pillow or by your bedside.
