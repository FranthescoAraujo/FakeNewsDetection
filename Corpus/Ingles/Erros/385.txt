BOSTON GLOBE 

Donald Trump is criticizing the FBI’s decision not to criminally charge Hillary Clinton. He says ‘‘now it’s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box.’’ 
Trump kicked off his Election Day eve blitz with a rally Monday in Florida. He told the Sarasota crowd that ‘‘the system is rigged, but at least we know it.’’ 
He claimed that ‘‘our country is a laughing stock all over the world.’’ 
The Republican nominee than pantomimed quotation marks when he said the word ‘‘justice’’ as he hit the FBI and the Department of Justice for their handling of the case. 
FBI Director James Comey notified Congress Sunday that a review of new emails connected to Clinton’s servers did produce evidence that would warrant charges.
