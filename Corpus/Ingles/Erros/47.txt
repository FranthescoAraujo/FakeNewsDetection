2435,Someone Made a Guide for What To Do If You See A Hate Crime,Tom Cahill,"Tom Cahill | November 11, 2016 
A brilliant guide showing bystanders what to do when seeing Islamophobia in public is spreading on social media. 
The guide instructs friendly bystanders to do four things in succession: Converse with the victim while ignoring the attacker, focus on a random subject of conversation that doesnâ€™t involve anything the attacker is talking about, maintain eye contact with the victim while refusing to engage with the attacker, and continue friendly conversation until the attacker leaves, while offering to escort the victim to a safe space. 
The illustrated guide, made by artist Maeril , is a 4-step guide that simultaneously shows how a bystander can make an Islamophobic attacker irrelevant while at the same time providing the victim with a safe space. Maeril, who lives in France, originally designed it for bystanders wanting to make Muslim citizens feel welcome after the terror attacks in Paris and Nice, said on her Tumblr that the guide can actually be used to help those being targeted by various forms of hatred and racism. Maeril asked those planning on following the guide to make sure to do two things: 
1) Do not, in any way, interact with the attacker. You must absolutely ignore them and focus entirely on the person being attacked!
