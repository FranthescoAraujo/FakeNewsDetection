11. Yglesias expressed joy when Andrew Breitbart died. Following Breitbart's death, Yglesias tweeted : ""Conventions around dead people are ridiculous. The world outlook is slightly improved with @AndrewBrietbart [sic] dead."" 
This tweet has also been deleted, and for good reasonâ€“celebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid, it's ghoulish, vile and reprehensible. And Slate defended Yglesias, stating that he ""is a very passionate journalist and Slate values that passion."" 
Apparently Slate believes that ""passion"" trumps basic human decency and a reasonable IQ level, and Yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities. ",1
