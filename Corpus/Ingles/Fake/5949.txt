Title: Form 1
This form would allow Ryan as well as Romney to run for President in 2016. Why would either man go to the time, trouble and expense to file this paperwork and then NOT campaign? Why? It makes sense that this has been the globalists Plan B all along with Paul Ryan waiting in the wings just in case Donald Trump’s candidacy could not be derailed.
Romney’s paper work, which has Ryan’s name on it makes him eligible to run. Also, Ryan has filed the same paperwork in order to run as Vice-President. Now that Ryan is registered, he, too, can run for President. This has always been the globalists Plan B. The forces have aligned and in a nonviolent confiscation of the candidacy process, the Republicans will ignore the will of the people and Paul Ryan would go to the head of the line in the line of succession. .
If Donald Trump is elected, by some miracle, he will be assassinated, just like Bobby Kennedy in 1968!
