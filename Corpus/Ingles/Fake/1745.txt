37 Jesus said to him, “ ‘ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind .’ 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself .’ 40 On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.” 
We should all constantly endeavor to become people of great love. 
Once again, that does not mean that you have to accept or approve of what others are saying or doing. In fact, often the loving thing is to point out that someone you love is being destructive to themselves or others. 
And as a nation, we are being self-destructive on a scale that is almost unimaginable. We are literally committing national suicide, and until we start radically changing our behavior it isn’t going to matter much who is in the White House. 
If you want to get your heart right on a personal level, a good place to start is by forgiving those that have hurt you or offended you. And that would include our politicians. I am certainly not saying that you should vote for anyone that stands for positions that are extremely offensive, but we can definitely forgive them and pray for them. 
In addition, if you have had relationships that have been broken during this election season, perhaps now is a good time to reach out in a spirit of love and forgiveness. 
Life is too short to go around holding grudges, and those that choose to forgive often find that they are the ones that are truly being set free.",1
