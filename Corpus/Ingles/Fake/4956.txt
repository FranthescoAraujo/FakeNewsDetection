JOE SCARBOROUGH: People in the press won’t like to hear there also is – as a Republican there’s a natural reaction to press bias and it has been so overwhelming even if it is has been earned. The media has taken sides. They’ve aggressively taken sides and they’ve admitted that we’re aggressively taking sides and I think you get some Republicans that see that every four years. It’s so funny. They do that every four years. Every four years it’s like the end of the world if a Republican gets elected president because they’re all racist. It’s the boy that cried wolf. Also, it’s such a confounding election where we go back and forth on what it’s about, Mike Barnicle said all along that it’s about Hillary Clinton. People say ‘I’m going to vote for Hillary Clinton as a protest against…’ and then after sitting on that for a couple of weeks that thought for a couple weeks they go ‘eh…maybe not.’

SCARBOROUGH: I got to say, Willie. Everybody that is saying it’s over and you’re a fool if you’re suggesting that the American people may have the final say at the voting booth are the same people that were saying in August, September, October, November, December, January, February that there was no way in a million years that Donald Trump would ever win the Republican nomination. Stating it just as emphatically as they’re stating now that we need to avert our eyes, this race is over.   8:20  ",1
